One player has the dark pieces  the other has the light pieces . Players alternate turns. A move consists of moving a piece diagonally to an adjacent unoccupied square. If the adjacent square contains an opponent's piece, and the square immediately beyond it is vacant, the piece may be captured and removed from the game by jumping over it.
